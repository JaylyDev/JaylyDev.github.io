# Cursed Minecraft Texture Pack

This is a cursed Minecraft texture pack, which makes Minecraft more cursed by switching a lot of textures. Please be aware that this pack has not been updated since 2019, so a lot of the newer textures may not be modified from this pack.

You should (not) try to play Minecraft with this texture pack, and try your best reached the end dimension to beat the ender dragon.

For your sanity I would not recommend you to download this texture pack, but below are some in-game screenshots I took back in 2019 for the texture pack:
