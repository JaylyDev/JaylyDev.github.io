This Minecraft add-on makes the mace smashing attack very dramatic, through the use of cutscene, achieved using the `/camera` command and a particle effect ported from Unity.

## How To Play

Download the add-on and apply the resource and behavior pack into the world. Trigger the better mace effect by performing a smash attack (which triggers when it is used after the player has fallen 1.5 blocks or more and hits an entity).
