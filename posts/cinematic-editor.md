The Cinematic Editor is a Minecraft editor extension that utilizing the `/camera` command for changing perspectives and designing cinematic scenes. The editor has the capability to control your camera perspective with Minecraft Bedrock Editor to allow players to make a Minecraft scene, without knowledge to use the `/camera` command.

The Cinematic Editor Extension allows you to control your camera perspective without the use of commands. Which uses Minecraft: Bedrock Editor and the `/camera` command to allow players to make a Minecraft scene.

## Similarities between ReplayMod

This cinematic editor has a similar concept to ReplayMod from Minecraft: Java Edition.

- You can create multiple keyframes in a scene. With it's simple user interface provided by the Mojang's Minecraft Editor to create camera paths, which the editor can utilize a player's camera to move from one place to another with different transition and time duration.
- cThe editor allows you to adjust the time duration and ease of a keyframe. There are more ease options than the actual ReplayMod!

## Major Differences

However, a major difference between this extension and ReplayMod is that the scene are played in real time since you cannot rewind Minecraft's gameplay footage within the game.

## Creating a Scene

![Create a scene with extension](/assets/posts/cinematic-editor/create-a-scene.png)

To create a scene with the editor extension, first click on the camera icon on the left. The cinematic editor panel will pop up on the right, scroll down to the **Stored Keyframes** section. This is where you will create a keyframe and a scene.

The '**Create Keyframe**' button will immediately saves the player's current coordinates and rotation into the extension, which can be viewed within the top part of the extension:

![scene data display](/assets/posts/cinematic-editor/jayly-cinematic-editor_8.png)

When the button is clicked, the keyframes dropdown will have an item with the location the keyframe is captured in. Doing this multiple times allows you to create a scene. The keyframes order are shown in the dropdown:

![keyframes dropdown](/assets/posts/cinematic-editor/keyframes-dropdown.png)

When the '**Play Scene**' button is clicked, the editor extension controls your camera and gets all the keyframes saved to generate a path for the camera to transit from one location to another.

> [!NOTE]
> The extension will only take control of the camera to run a scene given by there are data in the stored keyframes dropdown.

## Camera Transition (Easing)

![easing](/assets/posts/cinematic-editor/jayly-cinematic-editor_4.png)

The '**Ease Type**' button adjust the ease of a keyframe, different ease type allows the camera can move from one place to another with different motion. Which different ease types allows us to makeÂ the transition more natural in some scenes.

The following easing types are supported in the cinematic editor extension:

![easing list](/assets/posts/cinematic-editor/jayly-cinematic-editor--camera-editor_2.png)

> [!TIP]
> The image above is taken from [Easing Functions Cheat Sheet](https://easings.net) (easings.net). Check out the website to learn more about different methods of easing.

![easing selection](/assets/posts/cinematic-editor/jayly-cinematic-editor_5.png)

The '**Ease Time**' adjust the time duration from one key frame to another.

These two options are automatically saved to world, so data will not be deleted when leaving and joining the world.

And finally, the **Export Keyframes** button will transfer the data from Cinematic Editor extension to Cinematic Runtime, meaning you can play a scene outside of editor mode.

## Modifying Existing Keyframes

If you want to change the keyframe's ease, you can select a keyframe from the Keyframes dropdown. The panel will show easing details for the selected keyframe.

You can modify the ease type and the ease time for the keyframe. However you cannot modify it's position and rotation. You would have to delete the keyframe using the 'Delete Keyframe' button, then create a keyframe again.

## Scene Action

![scene action](/assets/posts/cinematic-editor/scene-action.png)

The Scene Action section in the extension panel allows creators to either play the scene, export the scene to Cinematic Runtime Add-On, or reset the scene.

**Play Scene**

This will play the scene which is stored in the Cinematic Editor Extension Add-On. To play a scene stored in Cinematic Runtime Add-On, use the Scene Player item.

**Export Scene**

Pressing this button will transfer the scene details from Cinematic Editor Extension to Cinematic Runtime Add-On. This means you can play the scene with the Scene Player item available from Cinematic Runtime Add-On without the Minecraft Editor or the extension.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Exporting Scene from extension to the runtime add-on requires both behavior packs activated in the Editor project.

**Reset Scene**

This action will reset all data of the camera scene from the Editor extension, and it cannot be undone once the scene is removed. This does not affect the scene in Cinematic Runtime Add-On.

# Cinematic Runtime Add-On

The Cinematic Runtime Add-On allows players to play a scene by sending scene data from Cinematic Editor in the release version of Minecraft.

This is made possible through exporting the scene data from the editor extension to another add-on. And the data is saved in world storage, so the scene can still be played when rejoining without the need to import the data again.

The video above showcase how you can export keyframes from the editor and import the data and play a scene in a normal Minecraft world.

## Import Scene from Editor to World

In the video, it showcased the extension has the capability to transfer a scene data to the runtime Add-On. Here's how you do it:

1. Apply both Cinematic Editor Extension and Cinematic Runtime Add-On to an Editor project.
2. Create a scene in the Editor UI, then press the **Export Scene** button.
3. Either using **Test World feature** or **export the project as world** in world settings to convert an Editor project to normal world.
4. Enter the world, and type the following command:

   ```
   /function cinematic/editor
   ```

## Creating a Scene

The runtime add-on now supports creating and editing a Minecraft scene without the Editor, by sacrificing the fancy UI given by Minecraft Editor engine.

Start by running the following command:

```
/function cinematic/editor
```

When executed, this form should appear when you have not created a scene:

## Scene Editor Mode

After pressing the create scene button, you will enter Scene Editor mode. There will be 3 items in your hotbar, and your whole inventory will be cleared until you exit scene editor mode:
