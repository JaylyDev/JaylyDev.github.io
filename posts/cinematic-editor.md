The Cinematic Editor is a Minecraft editor extension that utilizing the /camera command for changing perspectives and designing cinematic scenes. The editor has the capability to control your camera perspective with Minecraft Bedrock Editor to allow players to make a Minecraft scene, without knowledge to use the /camera command.

# Cinematic Editor Extension

The Cinematic Editor Extension allows you to control your camera perspective without the use of commands. Which uses Minecraft: Bedrock Editor and the /camera command to allow players to make a Minecraft scene.

## Similarities between ReplayMod

This cinematic editor has a similar concept to ReplayMod from Minecraft: Java Edition.

- You can create multiple keyframes in a scene. With it's simple user interface provided by the Mojang's Minecraft Editor to create camera paths, which the editor can utilize a player's camera to move from one place to another with different transition and time duration.
- cThe editor allows you to adjust the time duration and ease of a keyframe. There are more ease options than the actual ReplayMod!

## Major Differences

However, a major difference between this extension and ReplayMod is that the scene are played in real time since you cannot rewind Minecraft's gameplay footage within the game

## Play a Scene

Before running a scene, you have to create keyframes so the extension can generate a path for the scene.

The '**Create Keyframe**' button will immediately saves the player's current coordinates and rotation into the extension, which can be viewed within the top part of the extension:

When the '**Run Timeline**' button is clicked, the editor extension controls your camera and gets all the keyframes saved to generate a path for the camera to transit from one location to another.

> [!NOTE]
> The extension will only take control of the camera to run a scene given by there are data in the stored keyframes dropdown.

The '**Ease Type**' button adjust the ease of a keyframe, different ease type allows the camera can move from one place to another with different motion. Which different ease types allows us to makeÂ the transition more natural in some scenes.

The following easing types are supported in the cinematic editor extension:

The '**Ease Time**' adjust the time duration from one key frame to another.

These two options are automatically saved to world, so data will not be deleted when leaving and joining the world.

And finally, the **Export Keyframes** button will transfer the data from Cinematic Editor extension to Cinematic Runtime, meaning you can play a scene outside of editor mode.

# Cinematic Runtime Add-On

The Cinematic Runtime Add-On allows players to play a scene by sending scene data from Cinematic Editor in the release version of Minecraft. This add-on is limited to Minecraft Preview users currently.

This is made possible through exporting the scene data from the editor extension to another add-on. And the data is saved in world storage, so the scene can still be played when rejoining without the need to import the data again.
