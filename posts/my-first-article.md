# The First Post on the Website

Well, you somehow stumbled upon this tiny website, and now this tiny webpage. You've disappointed me. Anyway, I just wanna announce that I made a blog post on my website.

Nothing too particular at the moment, it's a way for me to test how things are working. Here's a picture to test if my code allows it to render.

Can you see it? if so, great!

On a serious note, I'm going to post more articles here, exploring different topics, and trying new things. So subscribe to jaylymc and stay tuned. Ok bye.
