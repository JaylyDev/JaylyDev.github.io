# The First Post on the Website

Well, you somehow stumbled upon this tiny website, and now this tiny webpage. You've disappointed me. Anyway, I just wanna announce that I made a blog post on my website.

Nothing too particular at the moment, it's a way for me to test how things are working. Here's a picture to test if my code allows it to render.

Can you see it? if so, great!

On a serious note, this website took me a full day to develop, and most of the time it's me fixing stupid bugs related to client-server (blame the past me of setting this up with no idea of what he's doing). I'm going to post more articles here, exploring different topics, and trying new things. Subscribe to jaylymc and check out the script API docs if you want to. Ok bye.
