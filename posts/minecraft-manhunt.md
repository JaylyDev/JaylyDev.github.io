![Thumbnail v1](/assets/posts/minecraft-manhunt/thumbnail-v1.png)

Minecraft Manhunt is a Bedrock Edition Add-On which brings the infamous skill based competitive game, where players have individual roles, where they can either become a speedrunner or a hunter. It brings many manhunt concept by Dream from the Java Edition of Minecraft into Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. The basic concept of the Add-On gameplay is the speedrunner needs to beat Minecraft before the hunter kills the speedrunner.

> [!WARNING]
> This Add-On has not been updated since November 2021 (Minecraft v1.17.40). It might not be compatible with latest versions of Minecraft.

## Core Gameplay Concept

> Check out https://mcpedl.com/minecraft-manhunt/ for full description.

### The Speedrunner's goal

Their goal is to beat Minecraft.

If they beat Minecraft or before the timer ends depending on the gamemode you're playing on which you haven't got killed by hunter(s), the speedrunner wins.

If the speedrunner died, they lose instantly.

### The Hunter's goal

Their goal is to kill the speedrunner by the end of beating Minecraft or the timer ends.

Hunter(s) has/have a compass which can track the speedrunner. Remember the compass works only in the overworld dimension, or last location if the speedrunner is in the Nether.

The hunter also has unlimited amount of life (excludes Minecraft Item Randomizer gamemode), the compass the game gives you cannot be moved, dropped, crafted with and the compass is not lost on death.
