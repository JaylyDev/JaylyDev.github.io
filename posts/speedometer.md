## Changing Speed Units

There are different measure units for speed. The most common units of speed are **metres per second (m/s)**, **kilometres per hour (km/h)** and **miles per hour (mph)**.

You now can change the pack setting so it shows different unit! This setting is changed based on invidiual player's preference.

You can change the settings via the following command:

```
/function speedometer
```
