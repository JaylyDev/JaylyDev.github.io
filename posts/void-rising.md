What happens if you made the void rises constantly in Minecraft? This add-on is made so the void rises every 5 seconds, making the game more of a challenge. Last player survive the rising void longest wins!

## Add-on features

When you start the game, The void starts rising from the bottom of the world.

> The void rises from y = 0, and y = -64 with the Caves and Cliffs setting enabled because this add-on is made before the release of Caves and Cliffs update.

You will also be surrounded by a border when the game starts.

When you are playing, the game displays the timer to show how long you have been in this game:

If you are playing this game in **singleplayer**, your goal is to **survive as long as possible**.
If you are playing this game in **multiplayer**, **last player survive wins**.

## Settings

In order to make the add-on compatible with low-end devices, this add-on has settings which changes the size of the border and the amount of chunks the void needs to rise.

### Change the settings

In order to change the settings, click the button next to the settings before the world starts.

> [!NOTE]
> This add-on is made before the release of Caves and Cliffs update. If you're on Minecraft version 1.17, I highly recommended using the Caves and Cliffs settings instead of normal settings to maximise gameplay experience.
